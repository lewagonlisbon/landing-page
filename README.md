# Landing Page

Simple web page developed during the webinar [Code your first landing page in 2 hours](https://app.livestorm.co/lewagon/code-your-first-landing-page-in-2-hours).

The website has been deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and is available [live here](https://lewagonlisbon.github.io/landing-page).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:lewagonlisbon/landing-page
cd landing-page
open . -a "Sublime Text" # or change Sublime Text with another editor
```

Open the HTML file in your browser or launch a Ruby server and go to http://localhost:8000:
